You're absolutely right to think about **streamlining** â€” your project combines translation, linguistics, embeddings, retrieval, audio processing, and visualization. While powerful, it could become unwieldy for a single developer or small team unless it's scoped wisely.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of **pragmatic ways to streamline** without gutting the long-term vision:

---

## âœ… 1. **Phase Down the MVP â€” Go Narrow Before Going Broad**

### Streamlined MVP Scope:

**Goal:** Take a sentence in English, translate it to Korean, and provide side-by-side breakdowns of each word with POS tags and translations.

* âœ… **No RAG yet**
* âœ… **No audio yet**
* âœ… **No ChromaDB**
* âœ… **Just static breakdown and alignment**

**Stack for MVP:**

* `FastAPI` backend
* UI using Open WebUI (custom route or iframe)
* Models:

  * `facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M` (translation, \~1.4GB)
  * `spaCy` (POS tagging)
  * `KoNLPy` (Korean POS)
* Optional: `awesome-align` for word alignment (use offline mode)

This gives you a tangible demo *very quickly* â€” and more importantly, something **sharable** that users can give feedback on.

---

## âœ… 2. **Decouple Components with Clear Interfaces**

Design the system modularly, with clean APIs between components:

* Sentence translation
* Tokenization & tagging
* Word alignment
* Embedding + RAG
* Chat tutor
* Audio

This lets you:

* Run most components independently
* Test performance + memory usage in isolation
* Swap out models easily

---

## âœ… 3. **Postpone Heavier Features**

Hold off on:

* **RAG** (e.g. ChromaDB + Mistral or Ollama)
* **Whisper/Piper for audio**
* **Grammar visualizations (D3.js)**
  Until:
* MVP is smooth and fast
* Thereâ€™s user feedback confirming value
* You can afford heavier compute (or users run locally)

---

## âœ… 4. **Cache and Precompute Results**

For a language-learning tool:

* Sentence breakdowns are often reused
* Store results as flat JSON in local SQLite or DuckDB
* Only reprocess if new sentence is submitted

This reduces model calls, saves memory, and improves UX.

---

## âœ… 5. **Hybrid Embeddings Strategy**

If you *must* do embedding:

* Use `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small` (\~450MB RAM) instead of large
* Use `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (\~120MB) for English-only subset

You can scale up to `e5-large-instruct` later.

---

## âœ… 6. **Use RAG as an Optional Plugin**

Rather than making RAG central to the system:

* Treat it as a tutor mode
* Let users opt-in for it
* Run it only when needed, reducing memory use

---

## âœ… 7. **Deploy Lite Versions**

If you want to share:

* Package a small precomputed set of 20-30 example sentences
* Avoid model downloads on first run
* Make a `lite` mode: No models, just HTML visualizations

## Summary: ðŸ“¦ Recommended Streamlined Stack

| Component              | Tool                               | RAM (\~GB) | Notes                             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| Translation            | `facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M` | \~1.4      | Smaller NLLB variant              |
| Tokenization (English) | `spaCy en_core_web_sm`             | <0.1       | Preinstalled small model          |
| Tokenization (Korean)  | `KoNLPy + Okt`                     | \~0.5      | Lightweight Korean tokenizer      |
| Alignment (optional)   | `awesome-align`                    | \~2.0      | Can be precomputed                |
| Frontend               | Open WebUI                         | n/a        | Custom route or integrate cleanly |
| Backend                | FastAPI                            | <0.1       | Very light                        |

Start with this and keep the rest modular and optional.
